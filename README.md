# UX-FEE-Crosspair-Polling-Project
A fun little project involving a UX Designer and Frontend Engineer pairing together to create a simple polling app.

### The Challenge 
Our brave and heroic leaders, Admiral Kate Chadha and Commander Chike Orjih, have found themselves in difficult times, making critical decisions that affect us each day. They have decided the only way the resistance can truly win is if you and your fearless comrades have a voice in these critical decisions such as does one use a une fourchette à poisson when eating oeufs en meurette while in the French region of Burgundy on the first frost moon of the fourth winter since the last long night’s moon. Dare I mention the always reassuring question of can you elaborate on [insert any topic]. We are in dark times people, but there is hope.

With your skills, we, the heroes of hope, will be able to make these critical decisions for our leaders and relieve them of these truly heavy weights they carry on their shoulders. Below you will find the requirements, but as every UX’er knows, the extra delights can make an experience stand out from another.

(Reminder, this is all for fun so have fun with it and get creative)

### Requirements 
- Display the question that is being voted on 
- A question can only be answered with one of two options: “yea” or “nay” 
- Display a live count of the “yea” and “nay” votes 
- Display a live percentage of the “yea” and “nay” votes 
- Display a live count of the total number of votes 
- Only one vote per person 
- Simulate voting: a random “yea” or “nay” vote will be cast at a random interval 
- Once 50 votes have been submitted or 1 minute has passed, voting is closed 
- When voting is complete, display the winning decision 
- Display the time remaining before the polls close

- Should be accessible 
 
## Stretch Challenges 
- Support dark and light mode 
- Display multiple questions 
- Make the poll closing time configurable 
 
## Reminder 
Keep in mind that your pair may be less familiar with your core discipline. This is an opportunity for you to help teach and mentor as much as it is for you to actively learn. Be patient and considerate, we’re all at different levels in various skills. Ask questions, and focus on learning and growing.
